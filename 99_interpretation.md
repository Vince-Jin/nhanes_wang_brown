*** Emotional Support
    1. The data for emotional support is mostly available through 1999-2008 (Social Support Questionnaire only available for these years)
       1. Between 1999-2008, 12,749 participants answered the question of "In the last 12 months, could you/SP have used more emotional support than you/s/he received?" (N=12,749).
       2. Among all these 12,749 participants, 870 participants had been diagnosed with stroke, 11,844 participants had not.
       3. Among all these 12,749 participants, **Everyone** claimed to have someone to help with emotional support, regardless stroke history.
       4. The basic demographic characteristics of these 12,749 participants were similar regardless stroke history, except median age. These 12,749 participants were more likely to be Non-Hispanic White (55.4% for no stroke and 58.6% for stroke), almost half-and-half in gender, and had median bmi around 28 kg/m^2 (28.0 for no stroke and 28.5 for stroke).
       5. The median age of stroke participants were higher as compared to the median age of no stroke participants (74.0 for stroke vs 64.0 for no stroke)
       6. Education levels were similar between stroke and no stroke participants for education level between some high school to some college/associate. As compared to no stroke participants, a higher percent of participants with stroke history had only k8 education level (25.4% vs 17.6%), and a lower percent of having an education level of college graduates and above. (10.7% vs 18.4%)
       7. As compared to no stroke participants, participants with stroke history were likely to rate themselves as falling into lower self-rated health status categories like "good, fair, poor". Only 3.4% (as compared to 13.5% for no stroke participants) participants with stroke history rated themselves as having "excellent" health status.
       8. Participants with stroke history were more likely to have medical conditions of hypertension (75.1% vs 46.5%) and diabetes (30.8% vs 15.5%) as compared to no stroke participants.
    2. **The data did not suggest difference by stroke history among needing more emotional support in the past 12 months (As indicated in Table 1)**
        |                       |:Stroke History:   |                  |
        |-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
        |Covariate              |Yes                |No                |
        |-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
        |Need More Support      |                   |                  |
        |     No                |9,607(81.1%)       |708(81.4%)        |
        |     Yes               |2,237(18.9%)       |162(18.6%)        |

    3. Logistic Regression Results:
       1. 11,168 participants were included in the regression model
       2. The regression results suggested that no significant differences among the prevalence odds of needing more emotional support in the past 12 months comparing participants with stroke history versus participants without stroke history. (aPOR [95% Confidence Interval]: 0.93 [0.75, 1.15])
       3. The regression results also suggested no significant differences among the prevalence odds of needing more emotional support in the past 12 months by medical conditions of hypertension (1.04 [0.93, 1.15]) and diabetes (0.98 [0.85, 1.12])
       4. Instead, the regression results suggested that self rated health status may be critical, as comparing to participants who rated themselves as having excellent health status, particpants rated themselves to have very good, good, fair, and poor health status had significantly higher prevalence odds of needing more emotional support in the past 12 months. (1.39 [1.14, 1.69], 1.80 [1.49, 2.17], 2.74 [2.24, 3.34], 3.26 [2.54, 4.17], respectively)
       5. Some implications:
          1. The insignificance of stroke and medical conditions may be the result of co-linearity between these variables and the self-rated health status variable, as these medical conditions can either be long-term or influence persons' functionablities critically. In other words, having these conditions or not may determine how participants rate their health status.
          2. Self-rated health status may possibly be an important variable for needing more emotional support, but requires further investigation.

*** Depression
    1. The data for depression is mostly available through 2005-2018 (After the new Depression Screener Questionnaire was applied). Between 1999-2004, depression questionnaires only about less than 10% of the participants answered the depression associated survey.
    2. The depression screener questionnaire was the actual PHQ-9 screener for depression, and any score above 5 (below 5 were considered as normal per guidance) were considered as having at least mild depression. A detailed depression type variable was also established to capture if the participants had no/mild/moderate/moderately severe/severe depression types.
    3. Between 2005-2018, 36,259 participants answered the Depression Screener Questionnaire thus their PHQ-9 scores were calculated.
       1. Among these 36,259 participants, 1,284 participants had stroke history and 32,799 participants had no stroke history.
       2. As compared to no stroke participants, participants with stroke history were **more likely** to have depression score >= 5. (40.7% vs 24.0%)
       3. As compared to no stroke participants, participants with stroke history had higher median of age (67.0 vs. 48.0).
       4. Participants were about half-and-half in gender, and more likely to be Non-Hispanic White regardless stroke history.
       5. As compared to no stroke participants, participants with stroke history had slightly higher median bmi (29.3 vs 28.1).
       6. As compared to no stroke participants, participants with stroke history again had more k8 and less college graduat and above for education level.
       7. Similar pattern to the emotional support participants were also observed for self-rated health status and medical conditions (hypertension and diabetes.)
    4. Logistic Regression Results (For Binary Depression Variable):
       1. 32,842 participants were included in the regression model.
       2. The regression results suggested that participants with stroke history had 46% higher prevalence odds of having at least mild depression (indicated as having PHQ-9 score above or equal to 5) as compared to participants without stroke history, and this difference is significant.
    5. Ordinal Logistic Regression Results (For Ordinal Categorical Depression Type):
       1. 32,842 participants were included in the regression model.
       2. The regression results suggested that participants with stroke history had 53% higher prevalence odds of having a worse depression severity type rather a less severe depression type as compared to participants without stroke history, and this difference is significant.
